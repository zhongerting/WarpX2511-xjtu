Step-by-step examples
=====================

We provide a set of tutorials to help you get started with WarpX.
These are examples that we present at conferences and workshops, so we will add to them over time.
You can find them on `the dedicated website <https://blast-warpx.github.io/warpx-tutorials/>`__.

So far we have two tutorials on two different topics:

  🪞 `Magnetic mirror <https://blast-warpx.github.io/warpx-tutorials/a-magnetic-mirror.html>`__

  💥 `Beam-beam collision <https://blast-warpx.github.io/warpx-tutorials/a-beam-beam-collision.html>`__

Check them out and let us know if you have any suggestions for new tutorials or improvements to existing ones.
You can find the source code for the tutorials in the `warpx-tutorials repository <https://github.com/BLAST-WarpX/warpx-tutorials>`__.
Feel free to open an issue or a pull request if you would like to contribute!
